# Hello and Welcome! 👋

I’m **Pavitralaxmi Pulakhandam**, and this is my corner of the internet — where cybersecurity meets curiosity.

Here, you'll find my thoughts, lessons, and experiences as I dive deep into the world of:

🚩 **Capture The Flag (CTF) Challenges**  
Breakdowns of real challenges, creative exploits, and the logic behind the hacks.

🔐 **Cybersecurity Concepts & Tools**  
From everyday techniques to powerful tools — if I use it or learn it, you’ll read about it here.

🛠 **Projects**  
I love building, experimenting, and applying security knowledge to practical use cases. Expect walkthroughs and open-source snippets.

🏅 **Personal Milestones**  
My wins, certifications, collaborations, and proud moments from the ever-evolving infosec journey.

## Why This Blog?

The field of cybersecurity is huge and ever-changing. Instead of just keeping notes to myself, I decided to create a space that could:

✅ Help others navigate similar challenges  
✅ Contribute to the global hacker and learner community  
✅ Document my personal learning trail and growth

## What’s Next?

I’ll be posting regularly — from **CTF writeups** to **exploit techniques**, **cyber news reactions**, and **project breakdowns**.  
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned pro, there’s something for everyone.

Stay curious. Stay ethical. And stay tuned! 🔥
